# Life-with-LLMs

## Intro
Welcome to the repo where I will be sharing all of my adventures involving LLMs. Specifically, I intend to add many notebooks containing curated examples that show off examples on how to use LLMs and Gen AI to create some pretty sweet projects.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- LLM APIs: OpenAI Chat-GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- Image generation with Dall-E
- Text-to-speech with OpenAI TTS API
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic systems and workflows with LangChain & LangGraph
- Video generation with SORA
- AI automation
- Gradio apps

## Work done so far
- [LLMs and Pirates](pirates_and_llms/): pirate-themed projects featuring LLM-powered chatbots. Here, you'll see *TTS (text-to-speech)*, *image generation* (DALL-E) and use of *tools*.
- [Code Works](code_works/): LLM-based apps that facilitate a couple of common coding activities.
- [InsureLLM](insurellm/): *RAG*-powered LLM app that can be queried on info about a fake insurance company and its records.
- [Amazon Product Pricer](product_pricer/): LLMs are used in a *regression* task to estimate the prices of products based on their descriptions.

## Work in progress
- [Multimodal Florist](multimodal_florist/): LLM-powered chatbot to assist with flower arrangements. Chatbot utilizes a *multimodal RAG* store containing images for flowers.

## Future work planned
- An agentic AI system that involves grabbing info from online or local files/db as appropriate.
- AI automation via n8n.
