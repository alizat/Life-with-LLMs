# Life-with-LLMs

## Intro
Welcome to the repo where I will be sharing all of my adventures involving LLMs. Specifically, I intend to add many notebooks containing curated examples that show off examples on how to use LLMs and Gen AI to create some pretty sweet projects.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- LLM APIs: OpenAI Chat-GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- Image generation with Dall-E
- Text-to-speech with OpenAI TTS API
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic systems and workflows with LangChain & LangGraph
- Video generation with SORA
- AI automation
- Gradio apps

## Work done so far
- [LLMs and Pirates](llms_and_pirates.ipynb)
  - created chatbots (using frontier LLMs) that
    - talk like a pirate!
    - make use of external tools
    - give out voiced replies (with OpenAI's text-to-speech API) in a pirate accent
    - generate images with DALL-E
- [Code Works](code_works.ipynb)
  - A couple of LLM apps that:
    - Add comments and docstrings to a given piece of Python code
    - Write unit test cases for the functions in a given piece of Python code
- [Rag Experiment](rag_experiment/rag_experiment.ipynb)
  - An LLM app augmented with a RAG vector store that can be queried on info about a fake insurance company and its records.
- [LLM Regression](llm_regression/llm_regression.ipynb)
  - LLMs are used in a regression task to estimate the prices of products based on their description.

***I will keep on adding more notebooks to this repo. Stay tuned!***
