# Life-with-LLMs

## Intro
Welcome to the repo where I will be sharing all of my adventures involving LLMs. Specifically, I intend to add many notebooks containing curated examples that show off examples on how to use LLMs and Gen AI to create some pretty sweet projects.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- LLM APIs: OpenAI Chat-GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- Image generation with Dall-E
- Text-to-speech with OpenAI TTS API
- Agentic systems and workflows with LangChain & LangGraph
- Video generation with SORA
- AI automation

## Work done so far
- [llms_and_pirates.ipynb](https://github.com/alizat/Life-with-LLMs/blob/main/llms_and_pirates.ipynb)
  - used frontier LLMs via their APIs
  - created chatbots that
    - talk like a pirate!
    - make use of external tools
    - give out voiced replies (with OpenAI's text-to-speech API) in a pirate accent
    - generate images with DALL-E
- [text_classification_with_transformers.ipynb](https://github.com/alizat/Life-with-LLMs/blob/main/text_classification_with_transformers.ipynb)
  - Text tokenization, embeddings, and classification with DistilBERT + fine-tuning on the [Emotions dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emotion)

In the near future, I will keep on adding more notebooks to this repo. Stay tuned!
